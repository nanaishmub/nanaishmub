### 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I'm currently a learner in the ALX Frontend Engineering program and pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Bayero University Kano. I started my journey into software engineering because I was inspired by how technology transforms lives — and I wanted to be part of building those solutions.

* 🌍 I’m passionate about **coding, technology, and its constant evolution**
* 🛠️ I aim to **build tools that make life easier or more enjoyable** for people
* 🚀 I'm especially interested in working on: **productivity tools**
* 💡 I'm continuously learning and improving my skills in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++**
